# The Repository
This repository (Coding Bootcamp Group Project 01) is where we (see collaborators or about page) develop the 
MacGuyver Drinking App.  Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also set side projects and roadmaps to our endgame plans.  
This source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.

# MacGuyver Drinking App

The MacGuyver Drinking App will provide our user with a list of cocktails which can be made by using 
a list of ingredients the user inputs into the App interface.  Using an API pull from The Cocktail DB API and the 
Image API the MacGuyver Drinking App will produce the cocktail lists and also provide an image of the cocktails.  

The MacGuyver Drinking App combines the information from The Cocktail DB API with an easy to use interface that 
allows the user to find drink names and images from a list of the ingredients the user has on-hand.  This functionality
is for the user on a time budget or those who are looking for a new drink to try without having to run to a store for
additional ingredients.
